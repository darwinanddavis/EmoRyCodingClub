Weren't able to attend the conference? Fear not. The `R` community is sharing their talk and workshop slides. Thanks to [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/blog/) for collating everything.

# Super useful and futuristic `R` tips and tricks  

Below are some useful tips and tricks I gleaned from presentations at the conference. It's a mix of tidyverse titbits for making workflow easier and future `R` development geared toward applied things like user experience and interactive apps, which is where `R`, science communication, and data analysis/viz is already deeply entrenched.

These examples were presented by super `R` users at the conference. I had to share some to show you how to bend `R` to your will to do equal parts good and evil. Links to presenters included if you want further info.   

## Pre installation notes   
Some packages may require installation from remote sources, such as Github, to which you'll need to prepare your comp with a software package downloader. Below is the quick and nasty way and more details can be found [here](
https://rstats.wtf/set-up-an-r-dev-environment.html#windows-system-prep
).  

For Mac, the software package compiler is called **Xcode Command Line Tools**. First, download it using the Terminal/command line:  
```{shell}
xcode-select --install
```

Then check you have everything set up in `R` by running the below command in `R`. You should then see the below confirmation. 
```{r, echo=T, results='markup'}
devtools::has_devel()
```
Your system should now be ready to download open source, in-development packages and package binaries.    

May run into this issue for Mac OSX Mojave: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/104296#317543

## Plotting 

Use user-defined variables in your `ggplot`   

- dewey and ggplot 

This throws an error because `ggplot` can't recognise the character string.

```{r,eval=F}
require(ggplot2)
my_theme <- theme_classic()
colour_var <- "class"
facet_var <- "drv"

ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_point(aes(displ, hwy, colour = colour_var)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(facet_var)) + my_theme
```


Placing `.data` in front of your variables and wrapping them with double square braces '[[]]' solves this.  
```{r}
require(ggplot2)
colour_var <- "class"
facet_var <- "drv"

ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_point(aes(displ, hwy, colour = .data[[colour_var]])) +
  facet_wrap(vars(.data[[facet_var]])) + my_theme
```

# More advanced stuff  

Integrating css and bootstrap
